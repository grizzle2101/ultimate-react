---Styling Components:---
---1 - introduction:---
In this section we'll look at various methods for styling our components.

-vanilla css
-css modules
-css in JS
-using css libraries


---2 - Vanilla CSS:---
So vanilla css is not something we should do all too often, its time consuming & tedious.
But incase you ever need to, lets show you how its done.


Step 1 - remove bootstrap:
remove the import from main.tsx
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";


step 2 - create css file.
create ListGroup.css in the same location as the ListGroup compoent.

Note:
Should styles be kept seperately? No. We want to achieve cohesion, so related things should be kept togther.


Step 3 - import:
import "./ListGroup.css"; add the style import into the ListGroup.tsc file.


Top Tip:
To avoid messy imports of multiple items associated with the ListGroup we can create an index file.
This is like a table of contents for everything ListGroup related.

created index file:
2 lines of code in the index file.

import ListGroup from "./ListGroup";
export default ListGroup;


Then look at the cleaner imports
import ListGroup from ".components/ListGroup/ListGroup";
to
import ListGroup from "./components/ListGroup";

By default, if we do not provide a file, the typescript compiler looks for index.ts, which tells us which file is
the default import.



Sidenote:
We also updated the git ignore to avoid the huge node_modules
note - git ignore node modules

Import the CSS in into the TSX file
