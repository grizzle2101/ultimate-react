Introduction:
In the previous section we covered the fundamentals of building an application with react, now we're
going to take on more intermediate topics Like
-managing & caching data with react Query
-state management with Zustand
-routing with react router.

This will enable us to deliver some new featurees to game hub like caching data, infinite scroll aswell as
the game details page.


Prerequisites:
-basics of typescript
-building components
-styling components
-managing component state
-calling backend services


What you'll learn:
-react query - data management & query. - we'll never have to useEffect() again.
It also comes with some great features like
    -caching
    -automatic retry
    -automatic refresh
    -paginated & infinite queries

-Global State Management
-reducers
-context
-providers
-Zustand library

What about redux?
With the tools at our disposal, react is no longer neccessary. We will elabourate on this shortly.


Routing with React Router:
We will learn to build multi page applications with react router, a game details page.

3 Essentials Topics will be covered:
-data management & caching
-global state management
-routing
